Title: Accessibility and Its Impact on University Web Engagement: A UK Perspective

Project Description: This project investigates the accessibility of UK university homepages and user engagement, with a focus on Russell Group and ex-polytechnic universities. The study aims to determine the most frequent online accessibility issues, evaluate the accessibility and user engagement of these homepages, and investigate any potential relationships between the two variables. This study used automated tools to examine accessibility, including WAVE and AChecker, SimilarWeb for user engagement and manually checked website accessibility statements.
